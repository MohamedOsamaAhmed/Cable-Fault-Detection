## Summary
The objective of this project is to determine the distance of underground cable fault from base station in meters using an Atmega32 microcontroller. The underground cabling system is a common practice followed in many urban areas. There are many electrical, telephone and other signal cables are laid underground.
Many time faults occur due to construction works and other reasons. At that time it is difficult to dig out cable due to not knowing the exact location of the cable fault.

## Main Functionality 
Open Circuit can be detected by measuring the capacitance between two wires. Capacitance of cable changes according to the length. The length of cable varies based on the location of cable cut (open).   As the cable is open parallel wire capacitance gets reduced based on this we can calculate the fault location. (Alert This way need more than wire in the same cable)

## Capacitance Measurement
Each capacitance meter relies on the same basic property of capacitors- the time constant. The time constant of a capacitor is defined as the time it takes for the voltage across the capacitor to reach 63.2% of its voltage when fully charged. Larger capacitors take longer to charge, and therefore have larger time constants. An Arduino can measure capacitance because the time a capacitor takes to charge is directly related to its capacitance by the equation:

TC = R x C
TC is the time constant of the capacitor (in seconds).
R is the resistance of the circuit (in Ohms).
C is the capacitance of the capacitor (in Farads).

## Algorithm for capacitance measurement code
1- Set discharge pin to INPUT (so it canâ€™t discharge the capacitor)
2- Set charge pin to OUTPUT and make it HIGH
3- Record the start time
4- Check the voltage repeatedly in a loop until it gets to 63.2% of total voltage.
5- After the cap is charged, subtract the current time from the start time to find out how long     the capacitor took to charge.
6- Divide the Time in seconds by the charging Resistance in ohms to find the Capacitance.
7- Divide Capacitance by capacitance unit which is constant for the same cable type you can get
   it by measuring capacitance for cable its length is known for you.
8- Discharge the capacitor. To do this:
    1- Set the charge pin to Input
    2- Set the discharge pin to OUTPUT and make it LOW
    3- Read the voltage to make sure the capacitor is fully discharged
    5- Loop and do it again
